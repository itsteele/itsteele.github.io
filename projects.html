        My most recent project was something I worked on with a partner in an annual
        hackathon offered at Quinnipiac University.  We created a website to help
        inform people of climate change and how it is affecting our Earth.  Although we
        didn't produce a final result it still helped me re-learn html, which in turn
        helped me finish this website.  You can find the project
        <a href="https://itsteele.github.io/Hackathon_2021/" style="color:red; font-size:115%; font-family:courier;">here</a>.
        A problem that we ran into was time management.  I had cross country practice
        in the morning so I missed the first few hours of the hackathon.  Also, my partner
        and I could have been better with our time management.  The language that we used
        was html and we used a version control system (GitHub) to work on the code together.
        If you are interested in seeing our code you can find it

        A second project that I worked on was a DMV-Simulator.  This was a group project and was a
        a simple program written in java that "simulated" going to the DMV.  We worked on the program together
        through a version control system (GitHub).  When the program is run it welcomes the customer and then
        assigns them a number which is their spot in line.  The program then calls everyone after the customers
        assigned number (all the way to spot 200) and then back down until they get to the customers spot in line.
        The customer then receives a message telling them whether or not they have all their paperwork.  The program
        is written to give the customer a 1% chance of having all their required paperwork.  Some elements that we
        could have done better were time management.
